                <p>WhiteStar Communications is a company based on user privacy.  However, simply saying we
                    believe in privacy isn't enough - the real proof is in our actions.  All of WhiteStar's
                    apps and services have been architected in ways as to assure our users the maximum possible privacy
                    and information security when using our products.</p>

                <p>WhiteStar and WhiteStar apps retain absolutely no user private data, do not data-mine, do not serve
                    targeted advertisements and do not collect metadata.  WhiteStar apps have an optional
                    phonebook registry service, which is an opt-in service that allows others to more easily search for
                    you on the our apps, but no data is ever permanently retained.  When you terminate service
                    with us, we do not store or retain your information.  Only you, the customer, retain any
                    data.  We also do not store user passwords (we have an optional password recovery
                    mechanism that allows you to store an unlock key on a friend or family member's device) and cannot
                    access any of the data on your WhiteStar app account.</p>

                <p>We have no Cloud back end, and have made functional, architectural changes to the way WhiteStar apps
                    operate as to provide users with the absolute maximum possible privacy.  WhiteStar doesn't
                    collect any data to sell or redistribute to third parties, and we do not profile any demographic
                    information about our users.</p>

                <p>WhiteStar Apps have no Cloud back end and your private message data is never saved on any WhiteStar
                    servers when you use WhiteStar Apps. WhiteStar cannot access any of the private message data in your

                    Directory services and no user private message data will be retained.</p>
                <p>We generally only collect the minimum amount of data to accomplish the task of user authentication
                    and provide users with a high-quality user experience. WhiteStar does not collect any data about our
                    users nor information regarding the use of our apps or services to sell or redistribute to third
                    parties, and we do not profile users or collect demographic information about our users. We never
                    redistribute user data to third parties or monetize your data in any way.</p>
