    content: >-
      We provide the underlying technology and that enables products and
      services to deliver cost effective, secure communications, ensure data
      privacy and preserves ownership of shared digital data for all technology
      verticals. Our technology transforms today’s internet from a very large
      network with billions of unknown connected endpoints to billions of
      networks with few known, trusted and secured endpoints.

            <h4>Privacy</h4>
            <p>Through first party trust peer to peer endpoint connections, you always know who you are interacting with, all the time. Network connections must ‘opt-in’ to communications preventing unwanted SPAM or Phishing attempts. No metadata collection is possible because there is no intermediate cloud storage, there is no opportunity for 3rd party monetization of your personal property.</p>

            <h4>Security</h4>
            <p>All Content (Messages, Images, and Videos) is encrypted in flight and at rest on all connected devices. Encryption is accomplished by advanced patent-pending AI which is the strongest allowed by US law and results in the absolute minimum surface area for cybercrime ensuring your content is always safe.</p>

            <h4>Ownership</h4>

    heading: Why Choose WhiteStar?
    content: >-
      We believe that an individual’s rights to freedom of expression, assembly
      as well as the right to (digital) privacy are fundamental to the human
      experience, and should be fastidiously protected against encroachment. We
      believe today’s internet providers and technologists have missed the
      opportunity to do the right thing for society so we stepped up and
      developed the WhiteStar Network Operating System and applications that set
      the standard for how to safeguard these rights.


      To us, it’s not simply enough to say we respect your rights - we wanted to prove our conviction by creating a technology that will change the way internet communications will be delivered in the future. We have made our technology accessible through Star Fury Restful APIs so that every application developer can leverage our technology to provide you with the same protections we provide our customers. At WhitesStar, we believe our technology is revolutionary and it will transform the way society digitally communicates whether it be through secure and private conversations or through the use of connected IoT devices. WhiteStar is your trusted partner.
