    heading: The WhiteStar Network

      The WhiteStar Network is a machine and device agnostic communications
      solution, capable of running on any modern smartphone or IoT device, and
      leverages the beyond-Moore’s-Law increase in compute and storage that has
      revolutionized the mobile and IoT industries in recent years.  By using
      these billions of user devices to support the network, WhiteStar is
      capable of delivering a communications infrastructure built on a
      decentralized ecosystem.


      Strong cryptography underpins the entire network, preventing hacking of user data and protecting user’s right of content ownership.  Unlike with a Blockchain network, there are no tokens required to send messages or deploy projects on the WhiteStar Network - instead, WhiteStar is available to create new applications in either of two form factors.  The first is called StarFury and is designed to act as a bridge/adapter for data centers that need to integrate using micro services and REST APIs.  The second is in the form of dedicated applications that have been integrated directly with WhiteStar’s APIs.


      WhiteStar is a fully featured solution for the next generation of network infrastructure, capable of being deployed with top-tier cryptographic security as an overlay to quickly and easily adapt existing and integrate new infrastructure, devices and machines into the network.  WhiteStar makes deploying world-class security a snap, with no need for developers to have extensive training on complex security models and networking infrastructure, and it does so at a massively reduced cost over existing legacy Cloud-based and Blockchain networks.

    heading: WhiteStar’s Fundamental Shift to Enable Developer Success
    content: >-
      The WhiteStar Network fundamentally shifts the burden of networking,
      scaling, connectivity, transport, identity management and security into
      the networking layer from the application.  This eases pain-points felt by
      all developers deploying applications on legacy Cloud based and Web3
      systems, and addresses potential human error where a developer may not be
      a subject matter expert in any one particular area.  This frees up vital
      human resources to concentrate on the application layer, saving valuable
      time and introducing an efficiency unavailable on other platforms.


      For example, one powerful benefit of the inherent features of the WhiteStar Network center around identity management.  The current state of the art requires developers who want to manage user’s identities - and any personal identifiable information associated with their identities - in very particular ways to protect user privacy.  However, given the inherent complexity and difficulty in device and application layer identity management, databasing and storage of PID, many developers who lack the skill, time, or are unwilling to properly manage user data leave vulnerabilities open in their applications.  Likewise, centralized repositories of private user information, for example information stored in the Cloud, are juicy targets for would-be hackers seeking to compromise users’ privacy and steal personal information.  This has serious implications when the targets hold immutable personal information like social security numbers, government identification, biometric data, among others, let alone information that could be financially damaging like bank account information, passwords, credit and debit numbers or private keys for cryptocurrencies.


      However, by moving the burden of securing this kind of information out of the application and into the network, it efficiently eases the developmental overhead associated with properly securing private user data.  WhiteStar is capable of intelligently securing user data at the end-device level, assured via a deceptively simple series of network semantics, artificial intelligence and cryptography that ensure user data is stored not only within the standards for best practice in user privacy protection, but also adapts to potential security threats as they emerge.  Likewise, WhiteStar’s advanced feature set is fully capable of alerting users and developers to any potential security threats, to allow them to adapt to the changing environment and mitigate network risk before it becomes a problem.  Once a “Bad Actor” is identified, the WhiteStar Network also ensures that actor can no longer interact with users’ applications, further fortifying the Network and its attendant applications against external hostile action.


      Because the burden of security is shifted to the Network, all of these benefits are baked in to any application deployed on WhiteStar, allowing developers to concentrate on building great applications without having to worry about securing the network back end.  This illustrates the power of a properly architected platform that can appropriately underpin the next generation of application development.
