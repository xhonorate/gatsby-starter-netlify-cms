      ###### Protection of Intellectual Property is another tool in the
      WhiteStar security toolbox.


      Having patents on key concepts and ideas provides legal and political recourse should an attacker attempt to exploit the network using various techniques such as “back” or “reverse” engineering the system or even through state or industrial espionage.


      WhiteStar has strategically planned its’ patent portfolio to protect its customers for a specific class of attackers that would seek to subvert that intellectual property as well as to provide maximum value to the company and its’ shareholders and to protect its’ competitive advantage in a world of evolving technology.       


      In furtherance of our security culture, WhiteStar goes to great lengths to practice secure communication even when discussing our Intellectual Property (IP).  Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) are required for all investor briefings, shareholder meetings, vendor discussions and employee interviews.  WhiteStar does not use contractors, does all development in the US and only hires US Citizens that have had or can get a security clearance.  Each employee who joins WhiteStar fully understands their obligation to protect our IP and how that protection helps to facilitate protection of our customers' information as well.


      Every employee is required to sign an intellectual property assignment agreement ensuring all inventions and work product created during their employment is assigned to WhiteStar Communications to be held on behalf of our customers.  In recognition of the value of WhiteStar’s IP, we have implemented a comprehensive employee incentive program to encourage employees to innovate and participate in the discovery and development of these new technologies.

      International Patents.  Key security technologies within the WhiteStar
      patent portfolio include, but not limited to:</Center>


      <ipaccordion>\

      {"title": "Systems and Methods of Salutation Protocol To Communicate Using a Private Overlay Peer to Peer Network", "text": "Salutation is a special protocol used by a pair of WhiteStar nodes to form a Cohort.  Once a Cohort is formed, then nodes can securely communicate with each other using a variety of peer to peer or hybrid peer to peer protocols.", "id": "US 11,265,325"}\

      {"title": "Systems and Methods of Securing Digital Conversations for Its Life Cycle at Source, During Transit and at Destination", "text": "One challenge of securing data at rest is knowing how long the data should be secured.  As the volume of information being secured grows then the challenge of keeping that information secured grows.  This patent covers how we apply life cycle policies to data at rest to reduce the volume of data that needs to be protected.", "id": "16/518,406"}\

      {"title": "Systems and Methods of Collaborative Application on a Private Network", "text": "When information is transferred (in flight) from one node within a conversation to one or more other nodes, then that information gets encrypted for each cohort (pair) of nodes using the unique pairing of keys derived from that cohort.  No group keys are ever used to transfer information from one node to one or more other nodes. ", "id": "16/518,491"}\

      {"title": "Systems and Methods of Enforcing Communications Semantics on a Private Network", "text": "This patent covers the semantics of how WhiteStar forms and protects information flows between nodes.", "id": "16/518,538"}\

      {"title": "Systems and Methods of Gesture Triggered Automatic Erasure on a Private Network", "text": "A system that directs the Sentinel AI agent to coordinate with the Guardian AI Agent to cryptographically remove sensitive information from every node that has a copy of that information within the WhiteStar network.", "id": "US 11,256,822"}\

      {"title": "Systems and Methods of Distributed Backup and Recovery on a Private Network", "text": "Provides a distributed and secure means by which information can be securely backed up and recovered in a peer-to-peer network.  Information is protected both in flight and at rest.", "id": "US 11,068,195"}\

      {"title": "Identity Management System Establishing Two-Way Trusted Relationships in a Secure Peer-to-Peer Data Network", "text": "Distributed means for creating a secure identity for nodes within the WhiteStar network.", "id": "17/343,268"}\

      {"title": "Crypto-Signed Switching Between Two-Way Trusted Network Devices in a Secure Peer-to-Peer Data Network", "text": "A means through which hybrid peer to peer sessions can be used to send secure packets in flight.  Packets in flight can be securely switched across multiple hops to flow from a source node to a destination node via some number of intermediate nodes while maintaining end to end encryption.", "id": "17/345,057"}\

      {"title": "Anti-Replay Protection Based on Hashing Encrypted Temporal Key in a Secure Peer-to-Peer Data Network", "text": "A means by which the Sentinel AI agent can detect a replay attack in the WhiteStar network and mitigate that condition through coordinating from a menu of actions between the Guardian and Navigator AI agents.", "id": "17/348,667"}\

      {"title": "Distributed Security in a Secure Peer-to-Peer Data Network Based on Real-Time Guardian Protection of Network Devices", "text": "The Guardian is an AI agent that is used to secure data in flight and at rest within the WhiteStar network.", "id": "17/361,501"}\

      {"title": "Distributed Security in a Secure Peer-to-Peer Data Network Based on Real-Time Sentinel Protection of Network Devices", "text": "The Sentinel AI agent can detect threats in real time within the WhiteStar network and either mitigating those threats autonomically or coordinating remediation actions with other agents or the end user.", "id": "17/361,538"}\

      {"title": "Distributed Security in a Secure Peer-to-Peer Data Network Based on Real-Time Navigator Protection of Network Devices", "text": "The Navigator AI agent coordinates with the Sentinel and Guardian AI agents in order to secure information in flight within the WhiteStar network by assessing the risk of utilizing any given network resource for communications.", "id": "17/361,593"}\

      {"title": "Directory Server Providing Tag Enforcement and Network Entity Attraction in a Secure Peer-to-Peer Data Network", "text": "We use tags to assure user rights over their content and to provide authoritative identity when associated with first class objects within the WhiteStar network.", "id": "17/372,607"}\

      {"title": "Localized Machine Learning of User Behaviors in Network Operating System for Enhanced Secure Services in Secure Data Network", "text": "How we protect users from being data mined by third parties while still allowing meta data to be used exclusively by the user’s own devices for the user's own benefit.", "id": "17/378,312"}\

      {"title": "Crypto Tunnelling Between Two-Way Trusted Network Devices in a Secure Peer-to-Peer Data Network", "text": "How we securely tunnel information in flight between two nodes via intermediate nodes without having a direct peer to peer relationship. ", "id": "17/389,574"}\

      {"title": "Password Concatenation for Secure Command Execution in a Secure Network Device", "text": "Concatenation of security related commands to be executed during login processing on a WhiteStar node.", "id": "17/409,067"}\

      {"title": "Secure Device Access Recovery Based on Validating Encrypted Target Password From Secure Recovery Container in Trusted Recovery Device", "text": "WhiteStar does not maintain a database of user passwords.  This patent describes how we enabled customers to recover their own passwords using a secure distributed recovery mechanism between two nodes that they trust. ", "id": "17/461,632"}\

      {"title": "Establishing and Maintaining Trusted Relationship Between Secure Network Devices in Secure Peer-to-Peer Data Network Based on Obtaining Secure Device Identity Containers", "text": "How we update and maintain security trust relationships between nodes over time.", "id": "17/477,208"}\
